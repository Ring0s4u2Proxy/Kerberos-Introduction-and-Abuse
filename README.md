First, one must understand the innerworkings of Kerberos 
In 2020, I was convicted in connection with a car accident caused by driving while severely sleep-deprived. At the time, I was under significant stress and failed to recognize how impaired I was. I take full responsibility for the incident and have since made important changes to prioritize safety and well-being to ensure it never happens again.
